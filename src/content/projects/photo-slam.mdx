## Problem
Real-time dense mapping with photorealistic textures is a challenge for low-latency robotic systems.

## Approach
We built a pipeline combining photometric alignment, loop closure, and texture synthesis to produce photorealistic maps that can be used for downstream tasks.

## Results
- Real-time performance at XX FPS on a laptop with a GTX X
- Qualitative improvement in map visual fidelity.

## Demos

## What I learned
Designing a robust photometric front-end, and tradeoffs between accuracy and throughput.
