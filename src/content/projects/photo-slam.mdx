## Problem
Real-time dense mapping with photorealistic textures is a challenge for low-latency robotic systems.

## Approach
We built a pipeline combining photometric alignment, loop closure, and texture synthesis to produce photorealistic maps.

## Results
- Real-time performance at XX FPS (replace later)
- Strong qualitative improvement in visual fidelity.

## Demos
- YouTube: [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLACEHOLDER)

## What I learned
Tradeoffs between accuracy, robustness, and throughput in photometric front-ends.
